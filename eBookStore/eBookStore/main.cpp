/* eBookStore is a small bookstore. There is a cashier station equipped with a computer. 
 * I need to develope a software package that will serve as the point-of-sale. This will make the computer
 * function as the cash register and keep an inverntoty file. The inverntoty file willbe a database of all 
 * the books in the bookstore.
 * 
 * The software is to perform the following tasks:
 * - Calculate the total of a sale, including sales tax
 * - Wehn a book is purchased, subtract it from the store's inverntory file
 * - Adds, changes, deletes and looks up books in the inverntory file
 * - Displays various reports
 * - Other functionalities will be added as needed in the future. 
 *
 * The software will be organized into three modules:
 * - A cashier module
 * - An inventory Database module
 * - A report module
 *
 * When the software is run, the user will be shown a meny on the screen, whch allows him or her to activate
 * any of the modules.
 *
